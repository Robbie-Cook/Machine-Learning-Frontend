# Machine-Learning-Frontend

A React front end for showing people machine learning problems.

This website is built with a different UI framework, [grommet](https://v2.grommet.io/), which looks really nice and is easy to use.
It uses Gatsby as a framework around React to do things like present pages, and has a CI environment which runs builds automatically off the master branch.
